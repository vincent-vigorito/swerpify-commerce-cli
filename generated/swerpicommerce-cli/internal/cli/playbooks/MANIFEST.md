# Playbooks for this CLI

This directory holds hand-authored playbook content embedded into the
binary. Each playbook is a JSON file (CLI choreography) plus a
`_notes.md` file (free-text gotchas / workarounds). Both ship as
embedded data and auto-install into the `learning_playbooks` table
at first DB open.

## Adding a playbook

1. Create `<query_family_name>.json` matching the `learn.Playbook` shape.
2. Create matching `<query_family_name>_notes.md` with workarounds.
3. Bump `SeedVersion` in `embed.go` so existing installs re-seed.

## Convention

- One playbook per query family. Use `queryStructural` to predict the
  family-key collision.
- Notes are markdown; the agent reads them verbatim per SKILL.md.
- This `MANIFEST.md` stub keeps `//go:embed *.md` matching at least one
  file even when no playbook content exists. Do not delete it.
